## Summary

I am working my way through *Ray Tracking in One Weekend* (https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) and this is a record of my progress.


## Motivation

I am a student at BUas and our next project is an in-depth look at lighting in games. Before the project starts it seemed a good idea (and was highly encouraged) that we familiarize ourselves with ray tracing concepts.

Potentially, this may serve as a reference for me to look back on when I've forgotten how a certain task was accomplished.


## Additional learning

I also took this opportunity to finally start learning CMake. If you want, you can build this project with CMake, although it is only configured for Windows and for Visual Studio.

Each chapter is a separate project, which is a layout I had been interested in creating after seeing it in a few other places, like with Bullet Physics (https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) and Michal's OpenGL4 tutorial (https://github.com/michalbb1/opengl4-tutorials-mbsoftworks).

I'm certain my use of CMake is not following best practices or makes perfect sense. If you have recommendations on making it more correct, I'd love to hear it.
